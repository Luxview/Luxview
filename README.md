# Luxview
The premier luxurious multi-platform chat client. The goal of luxview is to replace the official/modded clients of a few chat services such as Discord, Revolt, Matrox and IRCs with an all in one client that has features from many popular modded clients integrated right in. This idea came about after I began getting tired of having to switch between multiple clients on multiple platforms and deal with updates that would often break modded clients. The best possible solution to me was to simply create an external client so using the dart language and flutter framework, I did just that.
# important notice
This client is in very early stages of development so many features are still being worked on or implemented. Please be patient. If you want to speed up development, create a pull request or join the discord (Soon)
